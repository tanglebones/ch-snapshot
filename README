This is a library for creating a snapshot of data that can be read only memory mapped by multiple processes that want to share data.

The idea is to move data that isn't updated often into a shared location.

Currently nested table support is weak. (The nested table gets copied into memory.)

TODO:
 - Add a nested table API so we can avoid coping the nested table bytes
 - Add helper for IKeyValuePair<string,string> to table
 - Add helper for IKeyValuePair<string,byte[]> to table
 - Add helper for updating the snapshot
 - Add tests for multiple processes using a snapshot
 - More tests!
